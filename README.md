Installing linux mint 20 in dual boot was quite easy
I have now to install node with the software manager sudo apt install npm


... Linux mint is user friendly, nothing scary !

``` 
sudo apt install npm
``` 
Then create-react-app
``` 
sudo npm install -g create-react-app
``` 
Don't forget git !
``` 
sudo apt-get install git
``` 

I managed to get visual studio code on linux : great !
